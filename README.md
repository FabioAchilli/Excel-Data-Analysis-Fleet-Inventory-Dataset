saved from .csv to .txt file, upload in excel, converted to .slsx file.
## Data cleaning: 
format as a table, 
format column C as Numbers, 
spell checking: correct some VehicleEquipment to Vehicle Equipment on Column,
a quick check that no empty rows are present, 
than look for duplicate rows of data (as there are no column with unique value and can not use Conditional Formatting, then Highlight Cells Rules, and then Duplicate Values) I use the Filter Option on Data tab with two level filters, first Department and then Equipment Class, both A-Z.
## Preliminary analysis: 
calculate the sum of the total vehicles with SUM function,
calculate the total number of unique Departments and unique Equipment Classes with Filter Advanced (including header rows into the formula) and then ROWS formula.
## Pivot Table and data visualization: 
4 different pivot tables with chart visualizations.
## Spreadsheet: 
1 spreadsheet with 4 charts to summarize/visualize different aspects about Departments, Equipment Class and Equipment Counts.
